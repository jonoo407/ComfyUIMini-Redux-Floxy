## Configuration & Port Setup

### üîå ComfyUI Port Configuration

**Default Setup** (Most Users):
ComfyUI typically runs on port `8188`. If you're using the default setup, no changes needed.

**Custom Port Configuration**:
If your ComfyUI runs on a different port, update `config/default.json`:

```json
{
    "app_port": 3000,
    "comfyui_url": "http://127.0.0.1:XXXX",
    "comfyui_ws_url": "ws://127.0.0.1:XXXX",
    "output_dir": "path/to/your/comfyui/output",
    "input_dir": "path/to/your/comfyui/input"
}
```

**Common Port Scenarios:**
- **Default ComfyUI**: `8188` (no changes needed)
- **Custom ComfyUI Port**: Replace `8188` with your custom port
- **Docker ComfyUI**: Often uses `8188` but check your docker configuration
- **Remote ComfyUI**: Replace `127.0.0.1` with the IP address of the remote machine

**üîç How to Find Your ComfyUI Port:**
1. Look at the ComfyUI startup message in console
2. Check your browser URL when accessing ComfyUI (e.g., `localhost:8188`)
3. If using custom launch scripts, check the `--port` parameter

### üåê Remote Access with Tailscale

Access your ComfyUIMini-Redux-Floxy from anywhere using Tailscale:

**Step 1: Install Tailscale**
1. Sign up at [Tailscale.com](https://tailscale.com)

    "comfyui_ws_url": "ws://YOUR-TAILSCALE-IP:8188",
    "output_dir": "path/to/your/comfyui/output",
    "input_dir": "path/to/your/comfyui/input"
}
```

**Step 3: Find Your Tailscale IP**
- **Windows**: Run `tailscale ip -4` in Command Prompt
- **macOS/Linux**: Run `tailscale ip -4` in Terminal
- **Alternative**: Check Tailscale admin console at [login.tailscale.com](https://login.tailscale.com)

**Step 4: Access Remotely**

## FAQ

### **Q**: How does this differ from the original ComfyUIMini?

**A**: This fork focuses on quality of life improvements, enhanced UI/UX design, better workflow management, and improved mobile experience. It includes custom enhancements for professional AI image generation workflows, plus the new Clear All, individual clear buttons, and extended seed randomizer features.

### **Q**: I can't import my workflow.

**A**: Save your workflow in API Format in ComfyUI (Settings ‚Üí Enable "Save (API Format)"). This fork includes enhanced auto-conversion that handles most workflow formats automatically.

### **Q**: What quality of life improvements are included?

**A**: Enhanced workflow management, improved mobile interface, better video support, streamlined queue management, Clear All button, individual clear buttons (üíÄ), extended seed randomizer for both seed and noise_seed, and various UI/UX improvements that make the experience more professional and efficient.

### **Q**: My ComfyUI runs on a different port, how do I configure it?

**A**: Update the `comfyui_url` and `comfyui_ws_url` in `config/default.json` to match your ComfyUI port. Replace `8188` with your custom port number.

### **Q**: Can I access this remotely from my phone?

**A**: Yes! Use Tailscale for secure remote access. Install Tailscale on both your host PC and mobile device, then update the configuration with your Tailscale IP address. See the Tailscale section above for detailed instructions.

### **Q**: Can I suggest new features or improvements?

**A**: This is a personal fork focused on specific workflow needs. However, feedback is always welcome for potential future enhancements.

### **Q**: Do I need to install all those node packs?

**A**: No! The node packs listed are only required for the specific custom workflow (flux_floxy.json). ComfyUIMini-Redux-Floxy works with any ComfyUI setup and workflows.

### **Q**: The clear buttons aren't working, what's wrong?

**A**: Make sure you've run `npm run build` after installation to compile the latest TypeScript changes. If issues persist, try refreshing your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R).
